## :grey_question: What is merging in Git
Merging in Git is one of the most powerful features of this VSC due to its ease to use and both time- and space-wise complexity. Merging, in simple words, means creating a new pointer to the current state of the repository. With this new pointer, one can easily create an alternative version to the current state of development and come up with new features. Thanks to this, it is not needed to duplicate all the work, and it makes the process of collaboration way more effective. 

In the following paragraphs, distinct types of merging will be introduced and described their characteristics, together with concrete examples.
