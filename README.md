# Version-Control-with-Git-JEM234---Final-project
By Krejcar Vilém, Tůma Adam

This is a homepage for our joint project for Master-level course Version Control with Git (JEM234) taught on IES. In our work, we're going to dig deep into the topic of "Advanced merging strategies".

The branch structure is the following:
* _main_ branch is the final, so-called __live__ code which should be the equivalent for the production version
* _dev_ branch is the intermediate branch, into which the individual collaborators are going to push their progress
* branches _dev_vk_ and _dev_at_ the the lowest-level development branches, meaning that into such, we are going to do the small code improvements, which will be then merged in _dev_ and put into the production later.
