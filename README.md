# Version Control with Git (JEM234) Final project
By Krejcar Vilém, Tůma Adam

This is a homepage for our joint project for Master-level course Version Control with Git (JEM234) taught on IES. In our work, we're going to dig deep into the topic of "___Advanced merging strategies___".

## :evergreen_tree: Branch structure
* _main_ branch is the final, so-called __live__ code which should be the equivalent for the production version
* _dev_ branch is the intermediate branch, into which the individual collaborators are going to push their progress
* branches _dev_vk_ and _dev_at_ the lowest-level development branches, meaning that into such, we are going to do the small code improvements, which will be then merged in _dev_ and put into the production later.

## :books: Content
